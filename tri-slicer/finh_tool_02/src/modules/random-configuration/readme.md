Random:
1. How many shapes?
2. How big (range of dimensions in terms of triangles they contain)
3. Symmetry





- include all edges in the partial shapes...



strategy 1:
- start with one shape.
- pick one more more free sides, and develop another shape from there...

---
Stategy 3:
Start with a block, and break it in the required number of shapes





grow vs divide



if you divide you need an initial outline, which can be the dimensions that you need...
And withing the boundaries you need... then it is just about dividing that...
You might also add another one, and remove it later (a smaller shape)

If you grow...
